Bit Manipulation means performing operations directly on bits (0s and 1s) of numbers, basically working at the binary level.
It's super useful for optimizing performance, solving logical based problems and doing low level programming.

basic 4 bit operations-
1. Get bit (to check if bit is 0 or 1)
2. Set bit (make a bit 1)
3. Clear bit (make a bit 0)
4. Update bit (set bit to 0 or 1)

Bit mask is a binary number used to select, modify or check specific bits in another number

How bit mask (masking pattern) generated-
A bit mask is generated by taking the number 1 and shifting it left to the position you want.
Ex- a mask for 3rd bit, then shift 3 times => 1 << 3

Bit masking means using the mask(the pattern) together with a bitwise operator to:
check a bit, set a bit, clear a bit or update a bit. Using &, |, ^, ~, << etc.
Its basically the action of applying the mask to a number.

How is the mask applied?
A mask is applied by performing a bitwise operation between: your number and the bit mask 

IN CASE OF GET BIT- we use bitwise AND operand
the operator checks each bit position one by one:
- wherever the mask has 0, the result is forced to 0 (ignored)
- wherever the mask has 1, the result depend on your number + operator 

IN CASE OF SET BIT- we use bitwise OR operand
the operator checks each bit position one by one:
- wherever the mask has 1, the result is forced to 1
- wherever the mask has 0, number's bit stays
